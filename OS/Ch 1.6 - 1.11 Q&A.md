# OS Ch 1.6 - 1.11 Q&A

1. virtualization vs emulation

   ```
   virtualization(추상화): allows operating systems to run as applications within other operating systems. virutualization includes emulation
   
   emulation: involves simulating computer hardware in software and is typically used when the source CPU type is different from the target CPU type.
   ```

   

2. network operating system vs distributed operating system

   ```
   network operating system: autonomous computers are part of a network that provides features such as file sharing and communication schemes for exchanging messages. However, each computer is independant from each other and acts autonomously.
   
   distributed operating system: different computers communicate closely enough to provide the illusion that only a single operating system controls the network. Compared to a network operating system, the distributed operating system is a less autonomous environment
   ```

   

3. 네크워크 종류들(LAN, WAN etc)에 대해 설명해라

   ```
   분류기준: distances between their nodes
   
    - local-area network (LAN): connects computers within a room, a building, or a campus
    - wide-area network (WAN): links buildings, cities, or countries
    - metropolitan-area network (MAN): link buildings with in a city
    - personal-area netword (PAN): using wireless technology to create a network between personal devices(computer, smartphone, etc)
   ```

   

4. bitmap이 무엇이며 왜 사용되는가?

   ```
   a string of n binary digits that can be used to represent the status of n items
   ```

   

5. distributed system 중에서 client-server model과 peer-to-peer model의 차이를 설명해라

   ```
   distributed system: collection of physically separate, possibly heterogeneous computer systems that are networked to provide users with access to the various resources that the system maintains
   
   pros:
    - increased computation speed
    - functionality
    - data availability
    - reliability
    
    client-server model: server systems satisfy requests generated by client systems.
    
    peer-to-peer model: unlike the client-server model, clients and servers are not distinguished from one another. Instead, all nodes with in the system are considered peers, and each may act as either a client or a server depending on whether it is requesting or providing a service
   ```

   

6. peer-to-peer model이 가지는 장점?

   ```
   services can be provided by several nodes distributed throughout the network, solving the bottleneck problems that the client-server model has.
   ```

   

7. cloud computing이란?

   ```
   a type of computing that delivers computing, storage, and applications as a service across a network. It uses virtualization as a base for its functionality.
   ```

   ```
   - Saas
   - Paas
   - Iaas
   ```

   ```
   - Public cloud
   - private cloud
   - hybrid cloud
   - multi cloud
   ```

   

8. open-source software vs free software

   ```
   - free software: source code is avaliable + licensed to allow no-cost user, redistribution and modification
   
   - open-source: source code available but does not offer the same licensing as free software
   ```

   

9. copyleft가 무엇인가?

   ```
   a form of licensing invented by Richard Stallman that gives anyone that possesses a copy of a copyleft work the four freedoms that make the work free.
   
   the four freedoms
   - to freely run the program
   - to study and change the source code
   - to give or sell copies with changes 
   - to give or sell copies without changes 
   ```
